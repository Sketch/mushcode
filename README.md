A collection of PennMUSH softcode (in-game code), also known as MUSHcode,
that I've seen fit to publish.
MUSHCode is a Lisp-like language to control objects in a virtual MUSH environment. It has a lot of neat features for a language, and is moderately beginner-friendly. An interesting paper on the features of MUSHCode and arguments for why learning it is a good programming foundation are here: [http://community.pennmush.org/book/enough-be-dangerous-conceptual-models-mushcode-5](http://community.pennmush.org/book/enough-be-dangerous-conceptual-models-mushcode-5 "A treatise on MUSHcode")

guest\_identity: Change the names of guests when they connect, based on custom mappings. Examples are given to bind guest names to IP addresses, produce pseudo-random names, and rotate through a fixed list (like on M\*U\*S\*H).

Myrddins\_BBoard: Performance and cosmetic improvements to Myrddin's BBoard System.

where: A simple +where that sorts by unique location. The appearance is easily altered.
